Based on initial analysis on the College Scorecard Dataset (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/), which includes information about the amount of financial aid that each institution's students receive, and the numerical data represents college attendance and persistence rates. We decided to examine the impact of different types of student aid programs on college attendance and persistence rates. Specifically, we will focus on federal grants, student loans, and work-study programs, and use regression analysis to estimate the effects of these programs on college attendance and persistence rates. We conducted different regression models to predict the complete rate, and studied the weights of diffrent factors, to show which factor is more influential to show if the student could complete the study.

The Modeling.ipynb shows the modeling and visualization process.

The RawData folder is the origin data with corresponding description.

In the BaseLine folder, we show our process using a toy case with a simplified dataset and method, the baseline is load data - preprocessing(split data) - conducting regression - output result.
